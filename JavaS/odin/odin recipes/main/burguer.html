            <h3>How to Make Basic Beef Burger Patties</h3>
            <strong> <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>1 large egg <br>

                ½ teaspoon salt <br>
                
                ½ teaspoon ground black pepper <br>
                
                1 pound ground beef <br>
                
                ½ cup fine dry bread crumbs <br></strong>
                
        <p>Directions:</p>
        <ol>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:<br><br>

            
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.

            Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
            
            Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). <br>
