Spice it up with cayenne pepper or add a little earthiness with herbaceous rosemary. You're only limited to the spices in your pantry.</h3>

            Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). <br>

            Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Cut each half in half lengthwise, and then cut each quarter in half lengthwise. You will have 16 wedges.<br>
            
            Place potato wedges in a large bowl. Add olive oil, paprika, parsley, chili, salt, and pepper; mix until well combined.<br>
            
            Place 1/2 of the potato wedges in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes.<br>
            
            Flip wedges with tongs and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Remove to a plate.<br>
            
            Repeat to cook the remaining wedges.<br>
